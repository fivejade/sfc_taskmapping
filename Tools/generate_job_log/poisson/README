The generate_job_log tool generates log data including execution profile and fragmentation value of jobs to analyze performance.  
It first reads the list of MPI_ID-hostname pairs generated by the record_computed_nodes tool. It then calculates the task fragmentation in each communicator at each level of the system topology by invoking the calculate_fragmentation_* functions. The tool outputs a csv (comma-separated values) file containing the job log.

Usage
./generate_job_log &> csv_file

For example,
./generate_job_log &> a.csv

record_compute_nodes tool

The record_compute_nodes tool records a list of compute resources allocated to the given MPI tasks according to the domain decomposition strategy. Specifically, it generates a stdout file containing a list of MPI_ID-hostname pairs, i.e., MPI task IDs and their host mappings. This list is further leveraged to compute the fragmentation of the currently mapped tasks. 

An executable file is to be built from source files using a make command as follows.
$ make 

Run
- Write a job script: run.sh is an example job script for PBS batch scheduler. Because record_compute_nodes tool is implemented on MPI library, it must be run with an mpirun program. The first argument on record_compute_nodes tool is the domain decomposition strategy, i.e. 2 for 2D domain decomposition and 3 for 3D domain decomposition. 

$ cat run.sh
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N test
#PBS -V
#PBS -q normal
#PBS -A inhouse
#PBS -l select=8:ncpus=64:mpiprocs=64:ompthreads=1
#PBS -l walltime=0:10:00

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
TOTAL_CPUS=$(wc -l $PBS_NODEFILE | awk '{print $1}')

OUTFILE=out.host.${TOTAL_CPUS}.${PBS_JOBID}
ERRFILE=err.host.${TOTAL_CPUS}.${PBS_JOBID}
# "record_compute_nodes 2" for 2D domain decomposition
# "record_compute_nodes 3" for 3D domain decomposition 
mpirun ./record_compute_nodes 2 >> ${OUTFILE} 2>> ${ERRFILE}

- submit the job script via a PBS job scheduler. Note that the total number of CPU cores must be 2^{n}x2^{n}x2^{n}, n = 1, 2, ... for 2D domain decomposition and 2^{n}x2^{n}x2^{n} for 3D domain decomposition.

$ qsub ./run.sh
